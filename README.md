# indigoBox Website
The indigoBox Website is the home of indigoBox on the web, and is developed as our front facing presecence, and a way to communicate what we do. The indigoBox website details all of our projects, explains our purpose, and gives short bios of all of our members.

The indigoBox website is hosted on GitHub Pages and is powered by simple [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It uses the jQuery bgswitcher plugin to handle the homepage slider.

## Running the site
The indigoBox website runs off Jekyll. Per their website, you can install jekyll by running `gem install jekyll`, which installs the jekyll gem.

To run the website locally, clone it and in your local directory run `jekyll serve`. The website should then be available at `localhost:4000`.
