# indigoBox Website
The indigoBox Website is the home of indigoBox on the web, and is developed as our front facing presecence, and a way to communicate what we do. The indigoBox website details all of our projects, explains our purpose, and gives short bios of all of our members.

The indigoBox website is hosted on GitHub Pages and is powered by simple HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It uses the jQuery bgswitcher plugin to handle the homepage slider.
